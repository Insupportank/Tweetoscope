      <h1>Tweetoscope Project</h1>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>This project aims to assess your ability to implement the different concepts and technologies presented in the course. The chosen application computes statistics from data from the Twitter API. This document explains in detail the work to be done. To help you get the most out of this project, we have listed the different tasks with the course milestone from which you can complete the task: don't wait until the last minute and start now!</p>
      <p>Important note: Due to changes in the Twitter API access plans policy on April 2023, the "Free" plan no longer provides read access to user profiles and tweets. For that reason, you will work with a set of pre-recorded tweets. Yet the code used the previous year is still available, in case you're willing to pay for a more elevated access plan, but it is marked as deprecated as we could not re-test it.</p>
      <h2>Presentation of the application</h2>
      <p>Tweets can include hashtags in their text.<br>
         Example:<br>
         <img src="tweetWithHashtags.png" alt="A Tweet featuring a hashtag: 'To celebrate #NationalDogDay send us cute photos [...]'">
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/galtier/3MD1510_IAL/-/tree/main/Tweetoscope/InitialTweetoscope">Git repository</a> contains a Java application that gets or generates Tweets, filters them out based on detected language (for instance), extracts the hashtags, counts how many times each hashtag appears in all the streamed Tweets, and displays the 5 most popular ones, sorted by the number of occurrences; the so-called "leader board" is updated in real-time.</p>
      <table style="width: 100%">
         <tr>
            <td style="width: 30%"><img src="screenshotTop5.png" alt="leader board after a few Tweets"></td>
            <td style="width: 30%"><img src="screenshotTop5_2.png" alt="same leader board after more Tweets"></td>
            <td style="width: 30%"><img src="screenshotTop5_3.png" alt="same leader board after even more Tweets"></td>
         </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The application is already structured in components that implement the observer pattern to communicate. But it is not designed to handle a high volume of Tweets (when connecting to the "real" Twitter API the previous year, it only treated about 1% of Twitter public traffic, which was between 2000 and 4000 Tweets per minute), and it is not fault-tolerant.</p>
      <p>Your objective is to refactor the application to overcome these limitations. Your solution must use Kafka, and exploit a Kubernetes cluster for its execution. In addition, you must also demonstrate your GitLab CI/CD skills with this project.</p>
      <h2>Expected work and strongly-suggested timeline</h2>
      <h3>Tasks you can start working on right at the beginning of the course</h3>
      <h4>Task 1</h4>
      <p>Read this document thoroughly and completely.</p>
      <h4>Task 2</h4>
      <p><a href="https://centralesupelec.edunao.com/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=131998">Form a group with 2 fellow students using the Edunao interface.</a> 3 students per group, to be done by October 9th.</p>
      <h4>Task 3</h4>
      <p>Create a project on <a href="https://gitlab-student.centralesupelec.fr">GitLab-student</a> (not on GitHub, nor Gitlab.com!).<br>
         The name of the project must be <i>Tweetoscope23_GROUP-X_NAME1_NAME2_NAME3</i> (of course, replace "<i>X</i>" with your group number, and "<i>NAMEi</i>" with your names...).<br>
         Add Michel Ianotto and Virginie Galtier as members, with the "Developer" role.
      </p>
      <h4>Task 4</h4>
      <p>Create the skeleton of a LaTeX document that will be your report. A title and your names will be enough for now:<br>
         <textarea cols=50 rows=8>
         \documentclass[10pt,a4paper]{article}
         \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
         \author{Virginie}
         \title{Tweetoscope}
         \begin{document}
         \maketitle
         \end{document}
         </textarea>
      </p>
      <p>You can use <i>texmaker</i>, installed in the image, to edit your LaTeX sources and generate a PDF document; it is important for later tasks that you know the command lines to compile your source file(s) into a PDF document yourself (<code>pdflatex report.tex</code> for instance). You can use the <i>evince</i> application to display a PDF document.</p>
      <p>If you're not familiar with LaTeX yet, now is a good time <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes">to start learning LaTeX</a>.</p>
      <p>Add the LaTeX source file(s) to your Git (do not add the PDF file as it is generated from the .tex file, and you'll learn later how to publish it automatically).</p>
      <h4>Task 5</h4>
      <p>Study and run the provided source code.</p>
      <p>The starting point of the execution (<i>main</i> method) is in the <a href="https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/galtier/3MD1510_IAL/-/tree/main/Tweetoscope/InitialTweetoscope/src/main/java/tweetoscope/TweetoscopeApp.java"><code>TweetoscopeApp</code> class</a>.</p>
      <p>It starts by reading the program arguments:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            The Tweets source:
            <ul>
               <li><code>random</code>: a continuous stream of random crafted Tweets (doesn't require connecting to the Twitter API)</li>
               <li><code>scenario</code>: a predefined set of crafted Tweets (doesn't require connecting to the Twitter API)</li>
               <li>Deprecated <code>filtered</code>: connects to the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/introduction">Twitter search stream endpoint</a> and retrieves Tweets with given keywords</li>
               <li>Deprecated <code>sampled</code>: connect to the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/volume-streams/introduction">Twitter sampled stream endpoint</a> that delivers a roughly 1% random sample of publicly available Tweets in real-time</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            The filtering strategy:
            <ul>
               <li><code>none</code>: all Tweets are considered</li>
               <li><code>language</code>: only Tweets where the detected language is "en" are considered</li>
               <li>Deprecated <code>country</code>: only Tweets where the place is set to somewhere in "us" are considered</li>
               <li>Deprecated <code>userAccountCreationData</code>: only Tweets posted by users who created their account before a given year ar considered</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>The size of the leader board</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The next section of the <i>main</i> method creates the different components of the application.</p>
      <h5>Tweets Producers</h5>
      <p>The first component <code>tweetsProducer</code> is a component that generates or reads Tweets and injects them into the application. There are 4 possible producers, depending on the arguments of the program:
      <ul>
         <li><a href="https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/galtier/3MD1510_IAL/-/tree/main/Tweetoscope/InitialTweetoscope/src/main/java/tweetoscope/tweetsProducer/MockTwitterStreamRandom.java">MockTwitterStreamRandom</a>: as the name implies, this component doesn't connect to the Twitter API. Instead, it generates an infinite series of randomly built Tweets. Each Tweet text is a concatenation of hashtags chosen from a reduced set, and each Tweet is also assigned a language among a reduced list. With the previous access plan, this class was useful when too many requests were made to the Twitter API in the last 15 minutes and it was necessary to wait a bit before being allowed to submit more.</li>
         <li><a href="https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/galtier/3MD1510_IAL/-/tree/main/Tweetoscope/InitialTweetoscope/src/main/java/tweetoscope/tweetsProducer/MockTwitterStreamScenario.java">MockTwitterStreamScenario</a>: this is also a mock producer. It generates a predefined set of crafted Tweets.</li>
         <li>Deprecated <a href="https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/galtier/3MD1510_IAL/-/tree/main/Tweetoscope/InitialTweetoscope/src/main/java/tweetoscope/tweetsProducer/TwitterSampledStreamReaderSingleton.java">TwitterSampledStreamReaderSingleton</a>: connects to the Twitter sampled stream endpoint that delivers a roughly 1% random sample of publicly available Tweets in real-time.</li>
         <li>Deprecated <a href="https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/galtier/3MD1510_IAL/-/tree/main/Tweetoscope/InitialTweetoscope/src/main/java/tweetoscope/tweetsProducer/TwitterFilteredStreamReaderSingleton.java">TwitterFilteredStreamReaderSingleton</a>: connects to the Twitter search stream endpoint and searches for Tweets with given keywords. With the previous free account ("essential access"), there were restrictions on the number of filtering rules, and on the length of the rules; there was also a list of words that you couldn't use as keywords (such as "you" for instance) as they will match too many Tweets.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All producers implement the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.Publisher.html">java.util.concurrent.Flow.Publisher</a> interface. Warning: "Publisher" is quite a common name; note that this interface is not part of the Kafka library.</p>
      <p>To avoid launching multiple instances of the <code>TwitterSampledStreamReader</code> (for instance) by mistake (it will lead to incorrect results as the same Tweets might be produced twice for instance), all the <code>OnlineTweetsProducer</code>s follow <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton">the singleton pattern</a>.</p>
      <p>The <code>OnlineTweetsProducer</code>s start by checking if an environment variable named BEARER_TOKEN exists.<br>
         There are multiple ways to make that happen:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>change the Dockerfile (wait until you've learned more about Docker...)</li>
         <li>open a command window, type <code>export BEARER_TOKEN=YOURKEYHERE</code> and then launch Eclipse from the same shell window</li>
         <li>launch the program once, it fails because the variable is not set yet, but at least Eclipse created a run configuration. Right-click the project in Eclipse Project Explorer, and choose <i>Run As / Run Configurations...</i> to display the Java Application / TweetoscopeApp configuration. In the <i>Environment</i> tab <i>Add...</i> a new variable, <i>Apply</i>, and <i>Run</i>.
      </ul>
      <h5>Tweets Filters</h5>
      <p>The next component is the <a href="https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/galtier/3MD1510_IAL/-/tree/main/Tweetoscope/InitialTweetoscope/src/main/java/tweetoscope/tweetsFilter"><code>filter</code></a>. It subscribes to the publisher and when a new Tweet arrives, it examines it and decides to ignore it silently, or to propagate it down the application stream (as it also implements the Publisher interface). 3 filters are defined so far as explained above:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><code>FILTER_NONE</code>: forwards all the Tweets downstream</li>
         <li><code>FILTER_LANGUAGE</code>: if Twitter detects the language of the Tweet, it is indicated in <a href="https://github.com/twitterdev/twitter-api-java-sdk/blob/main/docs/Tweet.md">the <code>lang</code> property</a> as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag">BCP47 language tag</a>. This filter selects the Tweet where the value for this tag is "en".</li>
         <li>Deprecated <code>FILTER_COUNTRY</code>: selects the Tweets where the value for <a href="https://github.com/twitterdev/twitter-api-java-sdk/blob/main/docs/Place.md">the place/<code>countryCode</code> property</a> is "us" (note: getting the country code from a Tweet requires an additional request for the <code>placeId</code> property).</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Hashtag Extractor</h5>
      <p>The next component <a href="https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/galtier/3MD1510_IAL/-/tree/main/Tweetoscope/InitialTweetoscope/src/main/java/tweetoscope/HashtagExtractor.java">HashtagExtractor</a> subscribes to the <code>TweetFilter</code> and is in charge of extracting hashtags from Tweets (in fact that functionality is provided by the <a href="https://javadoc.io/doc/com.twitter/twitter-text/latest/com/twitter/Extractor.html"><code>com.twitter.twittertext.Extractor</code> class</a>) and publishing them for downstream processing.</p>
      <h5>HashtagCounter</h5>
      <p>The next component <a href="https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/galtier/3MD1510_IAL/-/tree/main/Tweetoscope/InitialTweetoscope/src/main/java/tweetoscope/HashtagCounter.java">HashtagCounter</a> subscribes to the hashtags published by the <code>HashtagExtractor</code> and maintains a list of &lt;hashtag string, number of occurences&gt; Each time a hashtag is received, the list is updated, then sorted by number of occurrences, and the top elements are extracted. If the top elements change from the previous update, the new top list is published.</p>
      <h5>Visualizor</h5>
      <p>The last component is the <a href="https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/galtier/3MD1510_IAL/-/tree/main/Tweetoscope/InitialTweetoscope/src/main/java/tweetoscope/Visualizor.java"><code>Visualizor</code></a> wich subscribes to the list published by the <code>HashtagCounter</code> and displays it as a bar histogram.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Add the code to your Git repo.</p>
      <p>When you subscribe to get access to the Twitter API, you are provided with a token or key. This string of characters must then be embedded in all requests you send to the Twitter server; it is used to authenticate your application and determine whether it is allowed to get the requested service (based on the chosen access plan and considering a limit on the number of requests made during the last day or month). Is it a good idea to save your token or key into the Git repo? Investigate and write a synthesis about your findings and thoughts in your report in a section entitled "Secrets and Git".</p>
      <h4>Task 6</h4>
      <p>When requesting the "real" Twitter API, each execution leads to different results since the Twitter live stream is unpredictable. For testing purposes (and because we have no other free option this year), it is convenient to feed the application with a pre-recorded set of Tweets. That's what the <code>MockTwitterStreamScenario</code> class is for.</p>
      <ol>
         <li>The <code>TweetFilter</code> receives Tweets #001 to #010</li>
         <li>If <code>TweetFilter</code> was set to <code>FILTER_LANGUAGE</code>, the <code>HashtagExtractor</code> receives Tweets #003 to #010</li>
         <li>The <code>HashtagCounter</code> receives "Failure, success, work, work, Failure, success, success, work"</li>
         <li>The <code>Visualizor</code> receives
            <textarea cols=20 rows=8>
            {#Failure=1}
            {#Failure=1, #success=1}
            {#work=1, #Failure=1, #success=1}
            {#work=2, #Failure=1, #success=1}
            {#work=2, #Failure=2, #success=1}
            {#work=2, #Failure=2, #success=2}
            {#work=2, #Failure=2, #success=3}
            {#work=3, #Failure=2, #success=3}
            </textarea>
         </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Even with a paid access plan, there are some limitations on the kind and number of queries you can make to the Twitter API. Working with a pre-recorded set of Tweets instead of with the live stream is therefore useful before the code is ready for production.<br>
         3 test bases are given:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>The file <a href="https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/galtier/3MD1510_IAL/-/tree/main/Tweetoscope/TestBases/scenarioTestBase.txt">scenarioTestBase.txt</a> contains the 10 Tweets crafted by the <code>MockTwitterStreamScenario</code> class.</li>
         <li>The file <a href="https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/galtier/3MD1510_IAL/-/tree/main/Tweetoscope/TestBases/miniTestBase.txt">miniTestBase.txt</a> contains 9 real Tweets.</li>
         <li>The file <a href="https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/galtier/3MD1510_IAL/-/tree/main/Tweetoscope/TestBases/largeTestBase.txt">largeTestBase.txt</a> contains 500000 real Tweets. You can use it for a more representative execution.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Write a <i><code>MockTwitterStreamRecorded</code></i> class that reads and publishes the content of one of these files. Remember to push your code to Git.</p>
      <p>Run the application with the largeTestBase read by your method. Results should be:<br>
         <a href="screenshotLargeBase.png"><img src="screenshotLargeBase.png" alt="expected result: hashtags Lovisland and bornova around 500, cerkezkoy and kapakli around 350 and ismir around 325" width=300></a>
      </p>
      <h4>Task 7</h4>
      <p>Create a new Tweet filter (for instance, only keep recent Tweets) and test it with the miniTestBase or a modified version of the miniTestBase more suited to your custom filter.</p>
      <h3>Tasks you can start working on after the first lab session (with some experience with Kafka)</h3>
      <h4>Task 8</h4>
      <p>Design the architecture of your solution: services (various Kafka producers and consumers), number of topics and partitions, structure of the exchanged messages, how messages are assigned to a partition, etc.<br>
         Document (and explain) your architectural choices in your report in a section entitled "Architectural Choices".
      </p>
      <p>In a "Risk Analysis / Initial Risk Analysis" section/subsection indicate what would be the impact of the failure of each component on the application: it will cause the application to crash, to hang, it will cause the application to display erroneous results, it will only slow down the application, etc.</p>
      <p>Don't forget to push to your Git.</p>
      <h4>Task 9</h4>
      <p>Implement your refactored architecture.<br>
         Use the console consumer and the miniTestBase file to ensure each Kafka producer outputs the right messages.<br>
         Make sure your solution also works when distributed across multiple machines.
      </p>
      <p>Push to Git.</p>
      <h4>Task 10</h4>
      <p>Check experimentally that the behavior of your application in case of failure is consistent with the risk assessment analysis performed in Task 8.</p>
      <h3>Tasks you can start working on after the second lab session (with some experience with Docker and Kubernetes)</h3>
      <h4>Task 11</h4>
      <p>Contenairize each of your services.<br>
         Run the application locally, using images stored locally, and starting each container manually.<br>
         Then upload your images to Dockerhub and rerun the application using the remote images.<br>
         Write a docker-compose file to automate the launch of the different components.
      </p>
      <h4>Task 12</h4>
      <p>Deploy your application on Minikube.</p>
      <h4>Task 13</h4>
      <p>Deploy your application on the InterCell Kubernetes cluster.<br>
         Assess its fault tolerance. Add a "risk mitigation using Kubernetes" section to your report.
      </p>
      <h3>Tasks you can start working on after the last lab session (with some experience with GitLab CI)</h3>
      <h4>Task 14</h4>
      <p>Set up a CI pipeline for your project so that the latex sources are automatically compiled into a PDF file, and the PDF file is published to the "pages" of your project. Update the README.md file with a link to the PDF file.</p>
      <h4>Task 15</h4>
      <p>Write a Junit test for the filter created in Task 7 and integrate the test into your pipeline.</p>
      <h4>Task 16</h4>
      <p>Integrate the build of the Docker images to your pipeline.<br>
         Change your Kubernetes deployment files to use the Docker images from your Git container registry instead of Dockerhub.
      </p>
      <h4>Task 17</h4>
      <p>Set up a process to check your code quality.<br>
         Incorporate to the CI/CD.
      </p>
      <h4>Task 18</h4>
      <p>Shoot a screen-shot video where you demonstrate:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>your CI/CD pipeline: change a piece of source code, push to Git and show what the consequences of the modification are (for instance: introduce an error in the filter or change the content of miniTestBase and show the unit test fails, of change a comment line in the counter file and show that the docker container is updated...)</li>
         <li>your solution in use; also shut down a node to show if the results are still produced</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Make sure your video's resolution is good enough to read the commands and code you show, and the sound is loud enough.<br>
         DO NOT put your video on Gitlab, nor send it by email. Instead post it somewhere else and add a link to it in your report and README.md file (if you use filesender, make sure to set the expiration date as far as possible).
      </p>
      <p>Complete your report to indicate:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>what you've learned by completing this project</li>
         <li>which parts were the most difficult and why</li>
